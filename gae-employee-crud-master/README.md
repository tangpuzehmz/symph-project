#CRUD Employee Record with Google Appengine in Python and Datastore (NoSQL)

This project is to showcase how to use create a very simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application with [Google Appengine] (http://cloud.google.com/AppEngine) in Python and NoSQL Datastore coupled with [Twitter's Bootstrap 3.3.1] (http://getbootstrap.com/) and [Jinja Template Engine] (http://jinja.pocoo.org/).

To try it out simply go to [employee-crud.appspot.com] (http://employee-crud.appspot.com/) and login with your Google account (whether it is @gmail.com or your custom domain under Google Apps for Business).

Feel free to Create, Update and Delete any Employee record as you like it.

I tried to keep the code very simple as this is not for practical use but educational purpose, it is to serve a reference for anyone who is new to Google Appengine /NoSQL Datastore and you wonder how to build a simple database application with it.
